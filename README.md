Online Video KYC

Currently Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process OR non-interactive online process. Create an online interactive process to do video KYC which is intuitive and self-sufficient. KYC should capture the userâ€™s live photograph and their basic details like name, DOB, address, pan card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, type of employment in a conversational manner. This tool should be highly inclusive and should have high reach across languages and generations irrespective of financial and education gap.
